## Features

- **Speech to Text**: Convert spoken language into text using Azure's speech-to-text service.

## Installation

### Create a Virtual Environment

We recommend creating a virtual environment to install the Audio Analyser. This will ensure that the package is installed in an isolated environment and will not affect other projects.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Getting Started

Install `audioanalyser` with just one command:

```bash
pip install audioanalyser
```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```
python server.py
```

This will start the CherryPy web server, and you can interact with the application through the defined endpoints.

### Requirements

The minimum supported Python version is 3.6.

- Azure Cognitive Services for speech and text processing.
- CherryPy for the web server.
- Python's standard libraries including asyncio, sqlite3, and threading.
