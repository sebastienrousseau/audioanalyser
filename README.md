### Create a Virtual Environment

We recommend creating a virtual environment to install the Audio Analyser. This will ensure that the package is installed in an isolated environment and will not affect other projects.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Installation and Setup

1. Install required Python packages:

```bash
   pip install cherrypy azure-ai-textanalytics azure-cognitiveservices-speech
```

2. Set up Azure services and obtain necessary API keys.

3. Configure environment variables for Azure services in a `.env` file.

### Getting Started

Install `audioanalyser` with just one command:

```bash
pip install audioanalyser
```
